# PickUpNewDate

The calendar. It's not complicated. It has to be simple. That's all.

The simple project of calendar written in JavaScript, CSS and HTML. It's also (potentially) Google Material styled. The calendar supports English, Polish and German.
In the future I would like to add more functions e.g. events viewer and synchronisation with data bases.

Running example of this calendar you can see here: http://tomaszmiller.pl/PickUpNewDate
